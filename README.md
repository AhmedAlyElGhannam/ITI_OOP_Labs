# ITI_OOP_Labs

This repository contains my solutions to the lab exercises in the course titled "OOP Using C++" in my ITI 9-month scholarship.

## Tools Used
All the uploaded code was NEITHER written on your average IDE nor compiled using GCC. Instead, a DOS emulator called DOSBOX was used to run a retro-development environment called BORLANDC. Setup process is fairly simple and the environment can be used on both Windows and Linux. Of course, I used Linux to make my Linux Guru proud. Setup instructions can be found [HERE](https://github.com/AhmedAlyElGhannam/ITI_C_Programming_Labs).
